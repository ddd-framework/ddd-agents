# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

First pre-release. Requires `mgamadeus/ddd` ^3.27.0, `mgamadeus/ddd-ai` ^3.2.1, `mgamadeus/ddd-argus` ^1.3.2,
`mgamadeus/ddd-common-money` ^1.1.1, `erusev/parsedown` ^1.7.

First version of the module: the agentic loop on top of ddd-ai.

- Conversations, messages, agent runs and turns, the task plan, purposes, delegation to sub-agents, schedules,
  mandates, compaction, the decision calls and the supervisor, with their repositories for MariaDB and PostgreSQL.
- The agent space (`AgentSpace`): the work context a conversation, a schedule and a mandate belong to. An
  application derives it and references its own entities from it.
- Conversation widgets and the composed view: block syntax, the widget registry, the kit of composed nodes and the
  names an application declares for its own blocks (`Widgets/Syntax/WidgetBlockFieldNames`).
- The MCP / JSON-RPC wire DTOs and the tool executor under `DDD\Presentation\Mcp\`.
- What an application declares instead of the module: its names outside a conversation
  (`config/app/AI/agentApplicationNames.php`), its wording towards the model
  (`config/app/AI/agentApplicationWording.php`), its purposes, skills, tools and widgets.
- `AgentsModule` with the namespaces the module owns (`AgentsModule::OWNED_NAMESPACES`).
